Version: 0.1

What it does: StarCatcher is a Java command-line program that extracts all the ratings from an iTunes program. 

How to use: With a JRE installed, you run this line from the command line ("java StarCatcher") from the directory in which the program resides. You will be prompted to open a file through a pop-up window--you need to find iTune's "iTunes Music Library.xml" file. Apple usually places this in the user's music (or "My Music") folder.

Please note that even though this is a command line program, you need to have a graphical interface present, i.e. Windows. You also may need to set the Java path correct in your OS*.

Depending on how many songs you've given ratings to, the program may take a minute or two to complete. The output is a file called "StarRatings.txt." The output will look something like this. I haven't tried this program on an Apple Mac yet, but it should work in theory, given that its is Java.
